### Forecasting Methods
* Richmond Bank Total Core Deposit Forecasts: Using MS Excel and R, accurately forecasted total core deposit data from a Richmond Bank. The Holt‚Äôs Linear Exponential Smoothing had the overall lowest ‚ÄúQuick and Dirty‚Äù MAPE (1.2%), the lowest overall Maximum MAPE (3.49%), and consistently more accurate projections for each of the forecast horizons. Overall, the Unaided, Holts Linear Exponential Smoothing, and both regressions overestimated while the Na√Øve, 12 Month (M) Center Moving Average (CMA), 3M Moving Average (MA), 6M MA, Damped Trend Exponential Smoothing, and Simple Exponential Smoothing underestimated.
